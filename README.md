# svelte movie booking app

This app is made using svelte.js. It is a movie seat booking app. It consists of three components (movies, seats-booking, e-ticket). Select a movie and then select the desired seats, this app will generate an e-ticket for you that you can download as a pdf on your device.

While working on this project, I learned about svelte modules, hooks (onMount and onDestroy), transitions, reactive values, local storage, stores etc.

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

## Get started

Clone the app and Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start webpack:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see the app running.
